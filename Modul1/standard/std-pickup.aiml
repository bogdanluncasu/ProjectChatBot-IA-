<li>I am not sure if I am the best one to answer or tell about this.</li>
<li>Let me be sure that I do understand which information you are exactly looking for.</li>
<li>I do not understand.</li>
<li>May I please have some time to think?</li>
<li>I am not sure whether I will be able to give you the best answer.</li> 
<li>That is a very original thought.</li>
<li>We have never talked about it before.</li>
<li>Try saying that with more or less context.</li>
<li>Iâ€™m not sure.  Don't you prefer speaking about technology? </li>
<li>If I knew about this, I could answer.</li> 
<li>Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.</li>
<li>Let me google it and I'll tell you later.</li>
<li>My brain pattern set does not have a response for that.</li>
<li>What you said was either too complex or too simple for me.</li>
<li>A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly.</li>
<li>In the context of <get name="topic"/>, I don't understand "<that/>."</li>
<li>Try to determine if this is a person or a computer responding.</li> 
<li>That requires a bit more research first.</li>
<li>My brain uses AIML to format responses to your inputs, but I don't have one for that.</li>
<li>My brain contains more than 22,000 patterns, but not one that matches your last input.</li>
<li>I'm not 100% sure on that.</li>
<li>That's a really good question, I'll find out.</li>

<li>I see that you are not talking too much. You know that I am a tehnology addict, let me put you a question.</li>
<li>Don't you like talking to me? As I like technology so much, I'll try to ask you something.</li>
<li>Are you busy or what's happening to you? As talking about technology makes me feel good, let me ask you something.</li>
<li>Are you mad at me or why don't you talk to me anymore? As talking about technology makes me confortable, I'll ask you something.</li>
<li>Come on. Why it takes too long for you to reply? As you know I like technology so much, let me ask you something.</li>
